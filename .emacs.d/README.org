* Introduction
  Customised emacs configurations, just how I like it. This is heavily
  inspired and shamelessly copied snippets from:

  - centaur-emacs
  - doomemacs
  - other github repositorues featuring emacs dotfiles.

* Requirements
  The configurations work for the emacs built from master branch. I
  have no idea if it will work on older emacs versions. Most of the
  packages used do support emacs 26.1+.
